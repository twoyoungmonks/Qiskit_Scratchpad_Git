**This repo is still in the early stages of development, there will be breaking API changes**

Qiskit Dynamics is an open-source project for building, transforming, and solving
time-dependent quantum systems in Qiskit.

The goal of Qiskit Dynamics is to provide access to different numerical
methods for solving differential equations, and to automate common processes typically performed by hand,
e.g. applying frame transformations or rotating wave approximations to system and control Hamiltonians.

Qiskit Dynamics can be configured to use either
[NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)
as the backend for array operations. [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is the default,
and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is an optional dependency.
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) provides just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation,
and GPU execution, and therefore is well-suited to tasks involving repeated
evaluation of functions with different parameters; E.g. simulating a model of a quantum system
over a range of parameter values, or optimizing the parameters of control sequence.

Reference documentation may be found [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/dynamics/),
including [tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/dynamics/tutorials),
[user guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/dynamics/userguide),
and [API reference](https://qiskit.org/documentation/dynamics/apidocs).

## Installation

Qiskit Dynamics may be installed using pip via:

```
pip install qiskit-dynamics
```

Additionally, Qiskit Dynamics may be installed simultaneously with the CPU version of
JAX via:

```
pip install "qiskit-dynamics[jax]"
```

Installing JAX with GPU support must be done manually, for instructions refer to the
[JAX installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
